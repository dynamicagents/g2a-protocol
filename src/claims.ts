/**

 * leaves the scheme open. Dynamic Agents' answer is a short-lived EdDSA JWT
 * carrying two namespaced claims. Those names are the wire: they are not
 * configuration, not derived, and not discoverable — the issuer writes them and
 * the verifier reads them, and there is no negotiation step in between where a
 * mismatch could be detected.
 */

/**
 * The JWS algorithm for every signature in the Dynamic Agents A2A wire — the
 * gateway identity token, the AgentCard signature, and the push-notification
 * callback JWT alike.
 *
 * A single value rather than a list, deliberately. Verifiers pin `algorithms:
 * [A2A_JWS_ALG]`, which is what makes algorithm confusion (`alg: "none"`, or an
 * HMAC verified against a public key) unrepresentable rather than merely
 * unlikely. Widening this to accept a second algorithm is a security decision,
 * not a compatibility one.

 * deployment* and can say nothing about which agent on it. This claim is the
 * only thing that can, which is why a verifier refuses a token that omits it
 * rather than falling back to a default: without it, `tenant` would be an
 * unauthenticated field in the request body, and a token legitimately issued
 * for one agent could be replayed against any of its siblings by editing that
 * field.
 *
 * This exact string is why the package exists. It was once
 * `https://looping.ai/tenant` on one side and `https://loopingai.org/tenant` on
 * the other; the verifier read an empty tenant, compared it to the tenant the
 * body addressed, and **every request 401'd**. Neither repo's build noticed,
 * because each side was internally consistent.
 *
