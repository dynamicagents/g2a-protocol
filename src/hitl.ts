/**
 * Human in the loop: how an agent asks a person something through its
 * gatekeeper, and how the answer comes back.
 *
 * A2A carries the exchange itself. The agent parks its task in
 * `input-required`, and the answer arrives as a new message on that same task.
 * What A2A leaves open is how either side finds the question or the answer
 * inside those messages — a `data` part holds whatever the two parties agree it
 * holds. These names are that agreement. Each part travels beside a `text` part
 * saying the same thing in words, so a client that knows none of this still
 * reads something sensible.
 *
 * Each name is a URI on a host Dynamic Agents owns, the way the claims in
 * `./claims.ts` are. A `data` part's `type` shares one flat namespace with every
 * other party's, so a bare word — or a host somebody else controls — is a
 * collision that surfaces only once two parties disagree about what it holds.
 *
 * The shapes are declared as types only. Whichever side reads a part validates
 * it, with the schema library that side already carries: a validator here would
 * be behaviour, and a dependency.
