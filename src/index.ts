/**
 * `@dynamicagents/g2a-protocol` — the Dynamic Agents gatekeeper-to-agent wire
 * contract: the claim names, well-known paths and audience rule a token issuer
 * and an agent runtime must agree on, and the parts a human-in-the-loop
 * question travels in. No runtime, no cryptography, no dependencies.
 *
 * **A change to any value here is a change to the wire** — bump the minor and
 * ship both consumers together. README.md is the full account: why the package
 * exists, what belongs in it, and what changing it costs. AGENTS.md is the
 * working rules for editing it.
