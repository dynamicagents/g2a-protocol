/**
 * `@dynamicagents/g2a-protocol` — the Dynamic Agents gatekeeper-to-agent wire
 * contract.
 *
 * The claim names, well-known paths and audience rule that a token issuer and
 * an agent runtime must agree on, and the parts a human-in-the-loop question
 * travels in — with **no runtime and no cryptography**.
 *
 * ## Why `g2a`
 *
 * Gatekeeper-to-agent. Agents never call each other directly; every call that
 * leaves an agent goes through a gatekeeper, so that anything an agent does
 * beyond its own boundary stays observable to a human. Subagents are not that
 * — they run inside one agent's boundary and never reach this protocol.
 *
 * The link itself is still A2A: this package adds only the authentication
 * choices the spec leaves open (§7.4). `g2a` is who may talk to whom; `a2a` is
 * how they talk.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own package
 *
 * The two sides of this contract cannot share code any other way.
 * `@dynamicagents/core` is the agent runtime; a gatekeeper is not an agent and
 * must not import it. So the contract lived as a comment in each repo saying "must
 * match the other," which failed exactly as that always does: one side moved to
 * the `loopingai.org` claim namespace, the other kept minting
 * `https://looping.ai/tenant`, the verifier read an empty tenant, and every
 * request 401'd. Both builds were green, because each side was internally
 * consistent.
 *
 * This package is small enough that depending on it commits a consumer to
 * nothing. It has no dependencies, imports no module — not `jose`, not
 * `@a2a-js/sdk`, not `node:*` — and touches no global but `URL`. That is
 * enforced at publish time by `npm run verify:exports`, not by convention:
 * a bare import anywhere in `dist/` fails the build. It is what lets a
 * gatekeeper depend on this while still importing nothing of the agent
 * runtime.
 *
 * ## What belongs here
 *
 * Only the choices **Dynamic Agents** made where the A2A spec left room:
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | claim names | the spec leaves client auth open (§7.4) |
 * | `EdDSA` | the spec permits many; pinning one is what we chose |
 * | `/a2a` | the spec lets an agent serve anywhere |
 * | `/.well-known/jwks.json` | RFC 8615, but not required by A2A |
 * | `audienceFor` | the spec does not specify audience derivation |
 * | `HITL_*` | the spec leaves what a `data` part holds to the parties |
 *
 * Anything the protocol itself fixes stays in `@a2a-js/sdk` — `AGENT_CARD_PATH`,
 * `A2A_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `A2A_VERSION_HEADER` are all exported there, already
 * shared by both consumers, and deliberately not redeclared here.
 *
 * The one exception is mechanical rather than a matter of ownership.
 * {@link NOTIFICATION_TOKEN_HEADER} is the SDK's own default, but the SDK
 * **does not export it** — it exists only as an inline fallback — so neither
 * consumer could import it and both declared it instead. A value nobody can
 * reference has no source of truth to be a second one of.
 *
 * Anything either side *enforces* stays with that side: the zero-trust
 * verification checks live in `@dynamicagents/core`, the card and endpoint
 * checks live in the gatekeeper. This package holds names and pure string
 * rules, and holding nothing else is what keeps it safe for both to import.
 *
 * ## Changing it
 *
 * A change to any value here is a change to the wire. The two sides do not
 * interoperate across it in either direction, so while this package is 0.x the
 * minor version is the signal — npm reads `^0.1.0` as `0.1.x` only, so a minor
 * bump is a break no consumer picks up by accident. **Bump it, and ship both
 * consumers together.**
 *
 * 0.3.0 did exactly that: the claim namespace moved to `dynamicagents.dev` and
 * the package was renamed, so `@dynamicagents/core` and `slack-gatekeeper` must
 * pick it up in the same deploy.
