 * These assertions are **literals, not references**.

 * Importing a constant and asserting it equals itself tests nothing. Spelling
 * the string out means a rename has to be made twice — once in the source, once
 * here — and the second time is the moment to notice that two deployed services
 * stop interoperating the instant one of them ships.
 *
 * That is the whole job of this file. Every other test in this package checks
 * behaviour; these check that a value did not change.
